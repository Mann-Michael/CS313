                <p>Hello. My name is Michael Mann. I currently work as a video game system designer and have for the last 15 or so years. I love pretty much all things nerdy. This includes board games, video games, technology, comics, you name it.<p>
				<p>I love understanding how things are put together and how they work. From a young age I took things apart and put them back together in interesting ways to try and improve them. I feel that my natural curiosity and 'outside of the box' thinking helps me in my career and will hopefully be an asset to this course.<p>
